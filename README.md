This Weather App uses react and Open Weather API to track and get the correct data for the correct location.
This app is in farenheight and I had to add a formulat to the weather temp class because the api return the weather
data in celcius.

If the Weather is less than 18°C the background will be a cold winter photo.
If the Weather is higher than 18°C the background will be a warm summer photo.
